This small application demonstrates running Java application as a Windows service, using recursion,
and using directory path watcher service to watch for changes on the specified path.
As a result, data from an xml file is transformed to a Wiki Markup language supporting only bold, italic, and heading.

To build a windows service from a java application Apache procrun is used. 
Procrun is a set of applications which allow Windows users to wrap (mostly) Java applications as a Windows service.
The library (commons-daemon-1.0.15-bin-windows.zip) can be downloaded from : http://www.apache.org/dist/commons/daemon/binaries/windows/ .
To run the application:
1.Export Java application as a runnable jar file
2.Update 'installService.bat' file to suite your environment (note: relative path to prunsrv.exe has to be used)
3.Run 'installService.bat' as an Administrator to install the service
4.Start the service
5.Add 'report.xml' file from 'resources' directory to the specified 'input' directory
6.The file gets processed and the output is saved into the specified 'output' directory
